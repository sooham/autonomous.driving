# CSC420 Final Project - Autonomous Car

A brief overview of each folder:
__report__ contains the project report `pdf` file.
__src__ contains all source code used in the assignment and referenced in
the report.


# How to run the code
In order to run the code in the folder, export a shell variable `CSC420` set
to the location of the root folder.

`export CSC420=~/path/to/CSC420_project`

Then in order to install all dependencies for the code, run
`pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt`

Then run the main file in `src` to start an interactive prompt allowing
you to execute the code.

`python2.7 ./src/main.py`
